## Where..?

I currently live in Amsterdam. I am Burkinabè, French, and American, and I have lived in a few different places, including New York and Madrid.

## What do I do?

I currently work as a full-stack software engineer at Disney Streaming, on the Disney+/Star+ Web team. I consistently dedicate time to helping others in the context of tech, through volunteering, mentoring and open coffee chats. I also draw and do DIY around the house.

## How (should you refer to me)?

I, for the most part, identify as a woman. For pronouns, you can use she or they.

## Who (let the dogs out)?
I have a dog named Pixel, who goes by Pixie, and usually alternates between being scared and silly.
