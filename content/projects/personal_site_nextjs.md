## The idea
This is kind of meta, but I realized my personal sites are also projects. This site was powering ornella.xyz and ornella.dev for one year (almost to the day, I realized after looking at the github!)

## Check it out
* [Source code on Github](https://github.com/0rnella/next_portfolio)
* [Live](https://romantic-shockley-828e66.netlify.app/)

## Making it
This site was my first [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project. I used [Contentful](https://contentful.com/) for the content, as at the time, I couldn't see myself writing in Markdown (after using Contentful and blogging consistently, I've come around.)

I did give this site a lot of love, as you can see from my github history. But in June 2022, I was going to make some updates to build an interactive ornellember calendar and the paradigm React was trying to force me into was inefficient performance-wise, which I found really frustrating (this is related to my vanilla JS fundamentalism) and decided to make a [new site](/projects/personal-site-zola).


## Next steps
I'm going to keep this thing up for future reference. I don't think it's a good idea to fork it, bc there are some references to the content IDs of my specific contentful instance, but I guess you could if you wanted to.
