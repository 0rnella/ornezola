## The idea
Created in June 2020, tool existed to consolidate info on bail funds, goFundMes and other organizations around the country related to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. It was built by 3 Black women.

The aim of the map was to help users find organizations around them and in other communities, to contribute to them.

## Making it
Our original source for bail funds and other organizations was this spreadsheet found on Twitter: [May 28 Resistance Funds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZIvDZpHqvNZkf8dGFXVjfk-Wq0Y9FTG410NJbH_8K8M/htmlview). We then went through each one and gathered information to fill this map. We cross-referenced our information with this list on Github curated by the National Bail Fund Network: [bailfunds.github.io](https://github.com/bailfunds/bailfunds.github.io/tree/master/_data/regions)

As far as technology, this is a purely vanilla JS site. I'm a Vanilla JS enthusiast (cough fundamentalist) and I did enjoy building this unencumbered by frameworks. 

## What's next
I should probably put up a banner on the site saying it's inactive. 

## PS
When this was released, I posted it in a couple places and business insider wrote [an article](/blog/feature-business-insider-resistance-map/) about it.
