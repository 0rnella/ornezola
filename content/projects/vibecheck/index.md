## The idea
Vibe Check is an ongoing project that researches the ethical choices of major American companies, particularly their commitment to racial equality. The project aims to give us, as consumers, the ability to make informed choices about our spending.

## Making it
Medina, Malcolm, Pamela and I were all looking for something to challenge us. In the wake of big statements by corporations inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, we were genuinely curious -- how does that translate to the realities of their impact? With Malcolm on PM duty, Medina on design, Pamela on data and code, and all of us on research, we built this over the course of a couple of months.

## What's next
I'd love for this project to keep growing, but none of us have had the time to maintain it. It remains how it was in January 2021.
